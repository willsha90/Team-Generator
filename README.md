# Team-Generator

The purpose of this application is to create a responsive team generator that allows a user to create a template that lists the number of employees within one team. 

Having utilized CSS, HTML, Javascript, the Inquirer NPM package and the NPM package, I was able to create a series of questions that were dependant on the employee type (manager, engineer, intern) For instance, Interns were the only employees that were asked what school they attend. I created specific javascript files per employee type and implemented logic unique to their field while. I then created an employee js file that aligned every employee type to address any overlapping data points utilizing constructor functions. Finally, I created a HTML Generator compiled all the user inputs and presented theme with the appriopriate context and styling (CSS).

The application commences within the integrated terminal where the user is prompted to select the employee type and a set of questions. Once an employee type's questions are completed, they are taken back to the first page where they can either add another employee type or exit the application. Upon exiting the application, the user is presented with a quick message and taken to a HTML Generated site detailing each of their answers.
